Module Assignment

Goal: To practice creating page layouts using Bootstrap and Sass.

Brief: Using Bootstrap and Sass, code the supplied design into a responsive layout.

Level 1 Process: You can use the CDN version of Bootstrap or customise the library using the source Bootstrap Sass files.

Level 2 Process: Use BEM to name your custom classes. Add them to the elements in addition to Bootstrap’s classes since Bootstrap does not follow BEM.

Resources: The required files can be found here.

Submission: Create a repository in your GitHub account called your-name-css-frameworks-ma1, e.g. mary-smith-css-frameworks-ma1 and make sure it's public.
Add, commit and push all your code to this repo.

Submit the repo link.
